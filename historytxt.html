The James Joyce Society
was founded in February
1947 at the Gotham Book Mart in New York City.  Its first
member was T.S. Eliot.  The Joyce bibliographer, John Slocum,
was the society's first president and Frances Steloff, founder
and owner of the Gotham, served as the its first treasurer.
In his book, <I>Wise Men Fish Here: The Story of Francis Steloff
and the Gotham Book Mart</I>, W.G. Rogers writes that the society's
original aims were "to introduce Joyce students to scholars,
maintain a Joyce library, further the publication and distribution
of his works, encourage the presentation of <I>Exiles</I>, and issue
occasional bulletins."
<p>
Since its founding, the Society has expanded its membership
and goals, and at its meetings presents a variety of Joyce-related
topics.  Normally four meetings are held each year with one on or close
to Joyce's birthday, February 2nd, and another around Bloomsday,
June 16th.<br><br>
