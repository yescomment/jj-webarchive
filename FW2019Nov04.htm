announces A DATE TO REMEMBER<br />
November 4, 2019<br />
5:30-7:30 pm</h2></font>
when we have our<br />
FIRST OPEN PUBLIC MEETING in many years at
<font color="red"><h2>Shakespeare & Co. Booksellers</br>
<b>939 Lexington Avenue<br />
(between 68th and 69th Streets) <br />
New York, NY 10065</h2></font>
All Wake readers are invited to join us</b><br />
in our continuing conversation about the Wake. <br />
Discussion leader Kevin Gilroy says: <br />
<i>We are starting on page 474, line 1, <br />
"Lowly, longly, a wail went forth." <br />
It's the start of the longest chapter (Book III, <br />)
and by many accounts the most phantasmagorical. <br />
It is the third watch of Shaun, now Yawn, <br />
who is the subject of a Starchamber Quiry by the four gossipelers. <br />
It ends with the famous "Haveth Childers Everwhere," <br />
HCE's self-defense as a great city builder. <br />
It's a great place to get back into the book<br />
for those who haven't been around for a while.</i><br />
<b>PLEASE NOTE</b><br />
Shakespeare & Co. has a cafe where drinks and snacks<br />
can be purchased and consumed during the meeting. <br />
YOU ARE ASKED not to bring outside food and drink into the store. <br />
AND – FEEL FREE TO BUY A BOOK OR TWO to support our new host.<br>
