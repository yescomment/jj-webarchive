<br></center></center>
The 2007 International James Joyce Conference will be hosted by the English
Department at the University of Texas at Austin.  The event will feature plenary
presentations and readings by Vicki Mahaffey, Paul Muldoon, Tom Staley, and Sean
Walsh; a round-table discussion with all the plenary speakers; panels on Samuel
Beckett's letters (Lois Overbeck and Martha Fehsenfeld), Elizabeth Bowen (Elizabeth
Cullingford), Tom Stoppard (Ira Nadel), contemporary Irish poetry, and such other
Joyce-related topics as copyright (with Carol Shloss, David Olson, and Robert Spoo), the
Harry Ransom Center, film, gender, music (Charles Rossman and Martin Dowling), race,
Shakespeare (Dolora Chapelle Wojciehowski), and "the wake of the Wake"; live
performances of Stoppard's Travesties by the Austin Shakespeare Festival; Joycean
music and film; a small exhibition of Joyce and Stoppard holdings at the Ransom Center;
a boat cruise on Town Lake. <br><br>
We welcome proposals and abstracts for both additional panels and individual papers,
and especially encourage submissions of work linked in some way to the Harry Ransom
Center holdings.  Proposals and abstracts should be limited to 250 words.  Non-plenary
papers and presentations are limited to a maximum of 20 minutes.  Submissions must
include name, contact information, institutional affiliation or independent scholar status,
and a list of any special equipment needed for your presentation. <br><br>
<b>DEADLINE FOR SUBMISSIONS: MARCH 1, 2007</b>
<br>
<br>
For those who have already submitted proposals for papers or panels, we do not <br>
plan to send out formal letters of acceptance until the first week of March, since <br>
the deadline for proposals is not until March first.  If you need such a letter <br>
before then, for institutional financial support with early application deadlines, <br>
please write to either Charles Rossman (rossman@mail.utexas.edu) or Alan <br>
Friedman ( friedman@uts.cc.utexas.edu). <br>
