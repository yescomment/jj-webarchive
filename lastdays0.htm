<br>
IS HE STILL DEAD?<br>
(A two character Play about James and Nora Joyce)<br>
What is fact is that in December, 1940, the Nazis were on the very heels <br>
 of the audacious writer James Joyce, and by association his beloved family.   <br>
 He had broken  all the rules, the least of which were grammatical, the <br>
 most titillating of which were sexual. What is fact is that this Writer <br>
 who defied all convention was the most devoted of husbands, the most loving <br>
 and heartbroken of parents. <p /><br>
What is fact is that now pushed to the very edge of occupied Nazi Europe, <br>
and residing precariously near Vichy France,  this  most wounded and <br>
miraculous of all families  had to pack up and run, like so many other, more<br>
 ordinary ones, dragging along beside their few belongings,  <br>
 their one most precious possession:  a small grandchild; and wrenchingly <br>
 forced to leave behind their tragic mentally ill and institutionalized <br>
 daughter.<p ><br>
 What is undoubtedly true, but not factual, is how they sang and wept, ate<br>
 and fought,  planned ,  hoped, despaired, and  then hoped again.<br>
This is a play written in a private language, the love-language of the man <br>
 who reinvented language itself.  These are his true but not factual ruminations <br>
 about money, health, food, and,  most  important, the nurture and<br>
 nature between he, James,and the Muse of his life, his beloved Nora.<br>
<p />
<br>
Mr. Freed will take part in a Q & A  immediately following the performance<br><br>
