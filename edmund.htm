<tr><td>With sadness, The James Joyce Society reports the death of one of our finest Joyce critics, a respected member of our society, and a beloved friend and teacher.  Eddie passed away early Sunday morning, April 1st, from complications of multiple myeloma.  His family plans a memorial service for Saturday, May 5th, at 2:00 PM, at the Unitarian Universalist Congregation at Shelter Rock, 48 Shelter Rock Road, Manhasset, Long Island, New York.
<p />


Eddie received his B.A. degree from Queens College of the City University of New York, Master's from Yale University, and Ph.D. from Columbia University.  A linguist and founding editor of the <i>James Joyce Review</i> (the first journal devoted to Joyce studies) and Language and Style, Eddie taught for a time at Southern Illinois University before accepting a position as professor of English at Queens College and at the Graduate Center, City University of New York, where he spent most of his academic life.  His work has provided an intellectual foundation for several generations of Joyce scholars. Eddie's sensitivity to the nuances of language and his skill at close reading have made his work, from his pioneering essays of the 1950s to the present, a rich and valuable source of approaches to Joyce’s complex narrative forms.  His articles have appeared in scholarly journals as well as in book-length studies of Joyce, and he is the author of <i>The Ordeal of Stephen Dedalus: Conflict of the Generations in James Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> (1971), <i>Language and Style</i> (1980), and more recently, <i>A Guide through Finnegans Wake</i> (2009).  He also edited <i>A Starchamber Quiry: Joyce Centennial Volume 1882-1982</i> (1982) and, with Richard F. Peterson and Alan M. Cohn, <i>Work in Progress: Joyce Centenary Essays</i> (1983), and he served on the advisory board of the <i>Joyce Studies Annual</i>.  Eddie was a musician with a beautiful voice and an accomplished pianist.  Many of us will recall his willingness to sing Joyce lyrics at Society meetings.  Eddie's wisdom, wit, and humor will be missed.  His enthusiasm for learning and dedication to students both within and without the classroom are legacies to his character and spirit as a man of genuine good will.

<! For Ed Epstein--Anecdotage from Sid Feshbach -->
<p />
1. Ed published five issues of the <i>James Joyce Review</i> (1957-58).
Around the third, maybe the fourth, issue he approached the Joyce
Society in New York City to secure affiliation, sponsorship, and
financial help. I don't recall if the Society had a working Board, but
the proposal appears to have been put before a committee (ad hoc
appointment by Frances Steloff?), for at a meeting of the Society,
with, as I recall, Padraic Colum presiding as president, the question
was scheduled for discussion and Leon Edel, seated in the front to the
left of the old Gotham Book Mart store, stood up to present the
argument that the Society should not join with Ed's publication. Not
only did it seem that the Board's decision had already been made, but
it seemed to me that Edel was snotty as though he was annoyed by the
very idea. Ed was the gentleman despite what smacked of a personal
attack. His proposal was turned down. (My erring memory recalls the
mother of the young Ed was involved, was funding <i>JJR</i>.) After this,
someone recognized that the Joyce Society should be publishing, and
Gotham Book Mart published the <i>Joyce Miscellany</i>, edited by Marvin
Magalaner: the first of three miscellanies is dated 1957, but clearly
it was kidnapping Ed's idea. The <i>James Joyce Quarterly</i>, begun in
1963-64, is now preparing to celebrate its fiftieth anniversary. After
Jolas's <i>transition</i>, Ed was the pioneer.
<p />
2. Standing in the back of an assembly of Joyceans, at a conference
organized by Nat Halper in Provincetown, listening to the presentation
of a paper, I whispered to Ed, standing next me, if he knew the
speaker. He gave me her name and he added she went to a college where
they taught the students how keep a smile from extending beyond the
corners of their eyes. The absurdity of this fit perfectly the
speaker's presentation of herself.
<p />
3. At a Joyce conference, probably the same one, Ed gave a paper in
which he compared the uncertainties in analyzing the <i>Wake</i> with being
able to play pingpong aboard a ship at sea. I found that true and
reassuring. At the same conference, Robert Boyle told us that at
probably a visit to Clongowes Wood he had asked some "Father Arnall"
to pandybat his hand. He did. And Boyle announced to us all, "It did
me some good." I did not find this assuring.
<p />
4. The Joyce Society and the Yeats Society sought for a moment to join
forces, and Ed was asked to give the paper for a meeting of both
groups. The paper was 80 per cent Yeats, 20 Joyce; perhaps Ed cut it
short because he had taken a long time, but it felt as though by
accident he had prevented a melding of the two. The two Societies
never joined together -- something I believe would still be useful for
both.
<p />
5. People have recognized Ed as a Joyce critic. He also edited a
linguistics journal. His longest term impact is likely to be as a
teacher. My last conversation with Ed was when he phoned to ask me for
a recommendation to the position of University Professorship at CUNY.
I agreed to write it and did. I don't know if he got the Professorship
-- but, as can be found in other statements here, if any academic in
CUNY deserved it, he did.

I first met Eddie at the Joyce Zurich Conference in 1979 when I was still a graduate student. I had heard of him from Marilyn Reizbaum, my classmate at the University of Wisconsin, and I knew he was a fine scholar. What I did not know was what a warm, self-effacing individual he was. We went to see Joyce’s grave at the Flutern Cemetery, and although I felt extremely awkward and very raw, he put me at my ease with a kind interest in the work I was doing and a ready supply of engaging stories about Joyce studies. When my wife, Paula, and I got jobs at Marquette, Bob Boyle made a point of educating me about those who had done so much to establish Joyce studies in America. Eddie’s name came up time and again, and Bob had a tremendous respect for Eddie’s erudition, energy, and humanity. Over the years, as I tried to get a sense of what I did not know about James Joyce, Eddie’s scholarship proved time and again a welcom tutorial, presenting sophisticated insights in accessible langauge. In the spring of 2009, I interviewed Eddie in New York as part of an oral history project of early Joyce studies in America. He was both a wonderful story-teller and an insightful critic of how the industry had grown up. Through it all, though he was clearly at the heart of much of what went on, he spoke of it all in the same self-effacing fashion I had noted thirty years earlier in Zurich. It was the last time we met. Though I did not see him often over the years, it was also a privilege and pleasure to chat with him. He did much for us all and will be greatly missed.

If Terence and Cicero and Montaigne hadn’t said it before, Eddie Epstein would have:  Nothing human was foreign to him.  That was probably the main reason you never knew where you were going to come across him next.  In retrospect, my first encounter, though the name didn’t register, was in 1963, reading <i>Lord of the Flies</i>, the book Eddie discovered and turned into a literary sensation.  (If William Golding didn’t give Eddie a shout-out the day he received the Nobel Prize for Literature, he ought to have.)  The last was two years ago, in reviewing his book <i>A Guide Through Finnegans Wake</i>.  I wrote that “Epstein is a curiously learned reader who says definite things in civilized prose.” That “curiously learned” bit, I’ve since come to realize, was ridiculously understated.   The book told you a lot about <i>Finnegans Wake</i>; it also told you about <i>Star Trek</i> author and avid <i>Wake</i>an James Blish, about the history of Dublin street lighting, about “a town near Naples, Piedigrotta, where local [singers] shout and cry out,” where “Caruso himself first appeared.”  Consider this one passage which, I venture, no one else could have written:
<p />
<table cellpadding=10><tr><td>The Wake’s orthography is likewise basically English.  The spelling in the book contains very few imported elements; there are no Southeast African suction clicks, no Welsh voiceless ls, no syllable tones as in Chinese or African languages.  Except for one witty passage studded with such exotics as acute, grave, and circumflex accents (124.9-12), there are no non-English accents at all.
</td></tr></table>
<p />
The erudition speaks for itself; what I would add is that it takes a brave man to write about what is not in <i>Finnegans Wake</i>.
<p />
	Here are some other things I’ve learned about him.  He was a great teacher (but that figures), who kept at it, exuberantly, well past retirement.  At age twelve, he was one of the Quiz Kids of the 1940’s radio program – that also figures: just look at that paragraph quoted above.  He helped establish the first New York chapter of the Mensa Society, then quit because no one could agree on meeting times.  He played violin and piano expertly and studied conducting at Tanglewood with Leonard Bernstein. (So: that explains how he knew all about Piedigrotta, and again, figures: I’ve never met a Joycean who didn’t love music.)  In the early fifties, when Joyce was very much <i>persona non grata</i> in Ireland, he was part of what was probably the first group to take a walking Bloomsday tour of <i>Ulysses</i> sites.
<p />
	None of these, however, would have prepared me for the moment, some years ago,  when I was reading a collection of essays on Joyce and came across something unexpected – what to me at least was a new thought on a big subject: “An anti-Semite does not so much lie about Jews as he lies about everybody else.”
<p />
	The man who wrote that, I think, was more than very smart.  Eddie  must have been around fourteen – for many of us, a rough age under the best of circumstances - when, a Jew, he started reading news reports about Auschwitz, not just as history, but as something happening <i>now</i>.  He grew up to write on the subject with exceptional clarity and sanity.  It is one of a number of things he did that I doubt I could have.
<p />
	Is it possible to feel nostalgia for something you never actually experienced?  The world in which Eddie came of age and flourished - the postwar New York of <i>Partisan Review</i>,  Abstract Expressionism,  feuding Trotskyites, the West End Bar, the Thalia Theatre,  when Duke Snyder was the third best center fielder in the city -  is one I wish I’d known, and a big reason for  that is that it was able to  produce someone such as Eddie Epstein, son of two immigrants, born in the Bronx, raised on the Lower East Side, graduate of the High School of Music and Art and Queens College – and, by the time he’d lived his eighty years out, author of ten books and scores of articles, founder of two journals (one of the them the first journal of Joyce criticism – another place where I encountered  his influence without knowing it), maker of music, maker of sense (and of humane sense at that), teacher of genius, forty-six year family man, father of three and grandfather of three more.   Wow.  To understate once more: a life lived well.

<p />Eddie and I worked on his magnum opus, <i>A Guide through "Finnegans Wake</i>."  The book is written in an aquatic form:  each ripple, each reach of the oar takes us further into the book's watery center.  My favorite bit of the book is when he tells an old joke from Punch, where a literary gent takes a girl to the beach and begins spouting Byron:  "Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean - roll!"  At which point the girl on his arm squeals with admiration and says "Oh Harold, you marvellous man - it's doing it!"  One could say the same of Eddie and his book:  he is so intimately aware of the workings of the Wake that you could begin to swear that he's responsible for its effects.  That will always be Eddie for me:  a man in a top hat conjuring up the ocean.

In the early 1960s, when I was a freshman in college, I read <i>Lord of the Flies</i> in a paperback edition to which were appended several pages of notes by someone identified only as E. L. Epstein. Later, when I became interested in (perhaps obsessed with) <i>Finnegans Wake</i>, I often encountered the same name, along with the intelligence and lucidity that had made the notes on Golding’s novel so helpful. I was particularly taken with "Interpreting Finnegans Wake: A Half-Way House," (JJQ, Summer 1966). Ostensibly a review essay on Bernard Benstock’s <i>Joyce-again’s Wake</i>, it was much more: in the course of 20 pages the essay provided an astute commentary on the state of Wake studies and on specific aspects of Joyce’s book, including a quite brilliant discussion of a/o pairings in the Wake that occupies over seven pages of this essay. I read and reread the piece, and I wanted to write like that.
<p />
In their attention to details and clarity of expression, Eddie’s authored books on <i>Joyce, The Ordeal of Stephen Dedalus</i> (Southern Illinois, 1971) and <i>A Guide through "Finnegans Wake"</i> (Florida, 2009), are like "Interpreting Finnegans Wake." His work was for me a model not just for his insights but for how he wrote: with a sense of humor and an appreciation of life’s absurdities that are especially appropriate for a Joyce scholar. Imagine, then, how pleased (and anxious) I was, three decades ago, to be invited to write a <i>Finnegans Wake</i> essay for <i>Work in Progress: Joyce Centenary Essays</i>, a volume he was editing in collaboration with Dick Peterson and Alan Cohn. At that time I had not yet met him, which made this gesture of confidence even more important for me.
<p />
During the 2004 Joyce conference in Dublin my wife and I shared a taxi with Eddie. Alas, all I remember of our conversation is that he chuckled when he told me his e-mail address was <i>bloom1866@aol.com</i>, 1866 being the year when our favorite literary character was born. But perhaps it’s fitting that the last thing I recall of Eddie Epstein, a man whose scholarship has meant so much to me, is that he wanted to share a joke that he knew I would find funny.

Generally Edmund Epstein and I managed to miss each other at the various Joyce conferences we may have attended.
<br /> <br />
An exception was Nick Fargnoli’s Joyce Society meeting of March 2010, the last time I saw him. We exchanged compliments, he generously responding to my initiation of the academic Hoflichkeit, I missing an opportunity to do more than just identify a lecture he gave years ago at the NYU Graduate Center on 42nd St.  that, let’s not exaggerate, did not dramatically "change my life," but guided me to experience one of the greatest profundities of poetic creation in the world, Goethe’s <i>An den Mond</i>. That enlarged my perception of genius, and the challenge of the literary historian to respond to it, for the rest of my life.

There are always those teachers you point to and say, because of you . . . .Eddie Epstein was for me one of those remarkable teachers. When I was an undergraduate at Queens College- CUNY in the early 70s, I had the
privilege of working with a number of remarkable teacher-scholars: Morris Dickstein, Paul Zweig, Robert Day, Alan Friedman. For a budding Joycean, Eddie Epstein was a key influence among these. When he spoke
about Joyce's work, or anything else, I knew I was in the presence of a brilliant interlocutor. Being green in the way undergraduates are, I did not quite understand then how important his work was for Joyce
scholarship. But I did feel a kind of support and permission to go ahead and only after I had gone on to pursue my graduate study of Joyce, and on subsequent meetings with Eddie, did I more fully appreciate the
generosity of his intellectual and pedagogical method. One abiding memory: One of the last papers I wrote for my undergraduate degree was for Eddie and I suppose, drawing on Valery's characterization
of such things, I was unable to abandon it. I remember driving out to the island (Long Island, NY) to drop the paper off, which Eddie kindly let me do.  When I say, because of you, Eddie, it's deep. Thank you.
To the family, my sincerest condolences and appreciation.

Eddie was a kind of living volume of annotations to Joyce's work: he had a prodigious memory, which could seemingly contain <i>everything</i> referenced by Joyce, from music-hall songs (which he sang, quite well: he also demonstrated a soft-shoe routine in class once) to poetry both canonical and obscure, from Irish history to turn-of-the-century NYC mayoral politics -- it was all in there, in the Wake and in Eddie's head. Rumor has it that he was a radio "Quiz Kid" as a child, which makes total sense. Anyway, it was always impressive to watch, and more importantly to hear: I used to like to stop by his office hours and ask him questions about Gerard Manley Hopkins just to hear him recite favorite poems.
<p />
Eddie was also incredibly generous: I met with him at his office in Queens a number of times before I enrolled, and he was always happy to sit and talk Joyce with a total stranger who had never attended a single one of his classes. I was really fascinated by was his office, a real classic "professor's office": sedimentary layers of books and papers on every available surface, decades of intellectual debris. I can only imagine the archive he leaves behind. After I became his student, he was very helpful, reading abstracts and drafts of conference papers, writing letters of recommendation at a moment's notice. He was truly a wonderful man, and a great teacher.
<p />
A year or two ago Eddie was included on a panel at the Grad Center discussing the "State of 20th Century Studies," or something along those lines. He definitely played the curmudgeonly "Old Guard" type the whole time (he still had a grudge against Derrida, after all these years), but my favorite moment was during the Q&A when someone asked the panel what books they thought students interested in current 20th century scholarship should read. Eddie's answer: "The Book of Job." Classic Epstein.

I first met Ed Epstein in the early sixties at the Gotham Book Mart, where
most of the Joyce activity in America was centered at that time. I wanted to
meet Ed to find out if the <i>James Joyce Review</i> was going to continue its run, for it had been suspended for several years. In my hubris of youth I thought
I would establish a Joyce journal, which became the <i>JJQ</i>, but I certainly
didn¹t want to conflict with <i>JJR</i>. From the very beginning, Ed was supportive
and served on the <i>JJQ</i> advisory board. I always admired his writings on Joyce
and found his early work on <i>Portrait</i> especially astute.
