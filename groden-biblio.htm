             <b>A bibliographical note on      
             Michael Lewis Groden,(1947-2021),</b>  Distinguished University Professor Emeritus in the Department of English and Writing Studies at Western University (London, Ontario), who passed away on March 25, 2021.<p>
             
             He gave or was slated to deliver eight talks for The James Joyce Society, a remarkable series that began some forty years ago in 1980. However, due in part to the Covid-19 epidemic, some of his recently scheduled appearances were subject to postponement and delay. “The Necessary Fiction: Life with James Joyce's Ulysses,” originally scheduled for March 20, 2020, was twice postponed. Previously he was scheduled to appear with William S. Brockman to present “Reading Joyce Again Through New Letters” on 15 March 2019. <p>
             His talk on on May 11, 2011 before The James Joyce Society on “Ulysses- and Us?" -- celebrating the publication of <i>Ulysses in Focus: Genetic, Textual and Personal Views"</i> --   was the first not presented at the Gotham Book Mart,  the venue for his previous Joyce Society talks, which are listed below.<p> .
