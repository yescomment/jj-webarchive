<br><br>Dear friends and colleagues,
<br><br>
Please find attached the final schedule for Omniscientific Joyce, the 27th International James Joyce Symposium. To join events on the day, simply click on the titles of the keynotes, roundtables, panels, postgrad. hangouts, and reading groups in the programme. The hyperlinks launch Zoom automatically and place you in the right Zoom Meeting or Webinar. We recommend you have a recent update of the software installed ahead of the symposium.
<br><br>
Again, we ask speakers, chairs, and all attendees to be mindful of your UTC offset. All times in the schedule are given in the 24-hour clock set to Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. Page four of the schedule lists the time differences from UTC for the countries and regions around the globe where our participants are located.
<br><br>
We advise speakers and chairs to join their sessions early. Our Zoom support team will admit panellists ten minutes before the posted start times to give you a chance to settle in, check your mike, and test screensharing. Attendees, you will be placed in the Waiting Room until the time listed in the schedule. Don’t be shy about using the chat function during the session – particularly for the four keynotes – whether to say hello or to ask questions during the Q&A (use the raise hand feature).
<br><br>
Omniscientific Joyce is the culmination of over two and a half years of planning, interrupted by an ongoing global pandemic. While we would love to have had you join us on the Adriatic coast in person and in the city that Joyce called ‘la nostra bella Trieste’, we are thrilled that so many people from the Joyce community will come
together next week for our online symposium. We look forward to a great week with you all.
<br><br>
Best wishes,<br>
John, Katherine, Laura, and Ronan.<br><br>

Please complete this Google Form and answer the security question in order to sign up for the symposium. There is no registration fee but, in order to participate, you’ll need to have paid your membership dues to the International James Joyce Foundation for the 2020–2021 year. Full details are available on the <a href="https://joycefoundation.utulsa.edu/">Joyce Foundation website.</a>

The <a href="https://nam02.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fdocument%2Fd%2F15G0P09iZYAZ2KEZZVDY9Qnu0GGpr9RX5oGuh2EBb8Ss&data=04%7C01%7Cehrlich%40emeritus.rutgers.edu%7C0986ffa87e45485c3f2b08888d9117a79c2%7Cb92d2b234d35447093ff69aca6632ffe%7C1%7C0%7C637560040202877328%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&sdata=5fCGc4YFxRdis%2Be%2Ba4Y8%2BJ3D6Ku9qmDevvHTk4L0y7A%3D&reserved=0"><u>symposium schedule </u></a>is now also online. We’ve attached a PDF version here but, for the live schedule, please consult Google Docs. We have over 180 participants in two dozen countries spread across the globe. Participants will be joining from twelve different time zones in June – with our two poles seventeen hours apart. In order to make sure everyone, no matter where they’re located, can attend a few sessions each day, the conference day stretches from UTC 07:00–23:30. That’s more than a sixteen-hour working day. Please don’t try to go to everything.
<br><br>
For a snapshot of the entire conference, take a look at the first page of the PDF.
<br><br>
All times are given in Coordinated Universal Time or UTC. Ireland and the UK, for example, are currently at UTC +1; Trieste, Zurich, and Paris are at UTC +2. We have included the time difference for each participant in their panel. If we’ve placed you on the wrong side of the planet and inadvertently scheduled you for four in the morning, please let us know. The registration form asks you to specify your time zone – you can notify us of any mistakes that way.
<br><br>
The schedule is a combination of three-paper and four-paper panels and single-panel and two-panel parallel sessions. But everyone delivering a paper gets their full twenty minutes: those on four-paper panels should not feel obliged to deliver a shorter paper.
<br><br>
All sessions will take place over Zoom. As pre-recorded content becomes available to us, we will add YouTube links to the live schedule. (Participants should also plan to play their pre-recorded paper during their panel.) Links to the Zoom rooms will be embedded in the final programme, issued as a PDF to registered participants only. UMass Amherst has very kindly allowed us to use their institutional Zoom license to host the conference.
<br><br>
Best wishes,
<br>John, Katherine, Laura, and Ronan.

<b>TRIESTE UPDATES<br>
4/19/21 ALL VIRTUAL; IN PERSON CANCELLED; IJJF MEMBERSHIP<br></b>
Mon 4/19/2021 3:39 AM<br>
Dear friends and colleagues,<br>
<br>
We regret to announce that we have to cancel the in-person portion of the Trieste Joyce symposium. We had hoped that with vaccines and the easing of national lockdowns, it would have been possible to host a small gathering in Trieste. While it looks like some social and public events may be possible by June, our planning window is unfortunately just too narrow now to arrange firm in-person activities. We are also conscious that making travel plans is still extremely difficult with rules changing by the week. After two years of planning for Trieste, we share your disappointment that we won’t be meeting face to face this June, but we look forward to seeing you on Zoom during the week of what promises to be a rich online symposium. We are happy to confirm our four plenary speakers: Eric Bulson, Catherine Flynn, Cóilín Parsons, and Colm Tóibín.<br>
<br>
The scholarship programme will go ahead for the off-year symposium but awards will be honorary only. As with previous symposia, we plan to publish selected contributions.<br>
<br>
Although we have some costs to cover we will not be charging a registration fee. We will, however, be insisting that all speakers, chairs, and indeed all participants, have paid up their International James Joyce Foundation membership in advance. The general membership fee is just $50 while the student membership is $30. We would ask you to do this as soon as possible so as to allow time for the processing of the memberships in time for the symposium. We would also appeal to those of you who can to make a donation to the Student Scholarship fund to help deserving and excellent emerging Joyceans take part in future International James Joyce Symposia. Payments are to be made here: https://payments.utulsa.edu/james-joyce-foundation-membership/<br>
<br>
Registration will open in a few weeks’ time: we ask that you all renew your membership or join the Joyce Foundation before then.<br>
<br>
We are now at work on finalizing the schedule for the online symposium and we hope to circulate a first draft soon. Many thanks.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Katherine, John, Laura, Ronan.<br>

<br>
Dear friends and colleagues, <br>
<br>
We’ve had a great response to the call for papers for the rescheduled Trieste symposium. <br>
<br>
This year presents some unique challenges for organizing and running the Joyce conference, not least because we hope to run events in Trieste as well as online. <br>
<br>
Participants will be joining from twelve different time zones in June – with our two poles seventeen hours apart. Just over half of the conference is within an hour of ‘Trieste time’ (UTC+2 in June) with the other main cluster (~30%) within an hour of North American Central Daylight Time (UTC-5). <br>
We want to ensure that everyone, no matter where they’re located, has a chance to participate. The conference day will therefore start at UTC09:00 with two parallel sessions in the evening for those in East Asia, Southeast Asia, and Australia; resume with a keynote in the European early evening (c. UTC16:00); and conclude with two parallel sessions starting at UTC18:00 or late morning/afternoon for those in the Americas. Our daily keynotes will be scheduled at a time that suits about 95% of participants.<br>
<br>
Livestreamed talks will take place over Zoom. Participants can also prerecord their presentations and upload them to online video platforms (YouTube, for example), in which case we will circulate links ahead of schedule and shorter conference sessions will be devoted to Q&A only. If you want to avail of this option, please do get in touch.<br>
<br>
In order to participate in the Joyce symposium, you need to join or renew membership of the International James Joyce Foundation. Full details are available on the IJJF website: https://joycefoundation.utulsa.edu/foundation/membership/<br>
<br>
And stay tuned for an announcement about IJJF scholarships to aid students who plan to attend the symposium in person.<br>
<br>
Clearly, the symposium has a lot of moving parts this year. The possibility of an in-person event in Trieste still depends on travel opening up by the summer and national vaccination programmes: we aim to make a final decision on the in-person event, one way or the other, by mid-May. We’ll be relying on the goodwill and patience of the Joyce community over the coming months, and we thank you for being a part of the conference.<br>
<br>
Best wishes,<br>
Ronan, John, Katherine, and Laura.<br>
