<p>
As a married graduate teaching assistant with a child and working
on a masters degree in English, my principal income in 1958 was
only about twenty percent of what it had been in my former calling,
the used car business. .What psychic income there was in the automobile
business died with my father the year after I got my B.A., and
when I returned to graduate school, I needed even more urgently to
continue working part time as a singer and producer of radio commercials
until I could land a full-time teaching job.  At Temple University I
took Joyce with Mabel Worthington, who at the time was
working on an index for her co-authored book with Matthew Hodgart,
<i>Song in the Works of James Joyce</i>.  Since I had access to a studio in the
Temple University radio station on Tuesday nights (making singing
commercials for the Clements agency), and to professional Philadelphia
actors who could do Irish accents, I offered to make a demonstration
tape of a chapter of <I>Ulysses</I> with the actual music referred to in
the text as background for Bloom 's thoughts.  Mabel agreed to accept
it in lieu of a term paper and I was on the way to a career glossing
Joyce's musical references.
<p>
When I completed the M.A. at Temple I got a job at the State University of New York,
College of Fredonia, and a scholarship to complete my Ph. D. at Buffalo, a major
Joyce manuscript repository,
where I was privileged to work with Tom Connolly.  Fredonia 's specialty
in the New York State system was music, and many of its undergraduates
were card-carrying members of either the musicians
union or the American Guild of Variety Artists.  The campus radio
station was right next door to my office, and after I smoozed around
for a month or so with the student staff and faculty director, I thought
I might possibly have the means to expand the earlier tape of the segment
from the "Lestrygonians" episode into a full-blown album of
the entire chapter.  I applied for a SUNY Research Grant my first semester
at Fredonia, and was awarded enough for supplies and professional
technicians to help with the project.
<p>
After five months of working weekends, the album was finished,
and I wasn't sure what to do with it.  I didn't know who might be interested
besides my wife and the cast, but Mabel, who lived in New
York while she went to Columbia, told me about a group of people
who loved Joyce so much they met four times a year at the Gotham
Book Mart to talk about him and pay homage.  I took a chance and
called Frances Steloff, the owner of the Gotham, to ask if at any time
in years to come they might give me the opportunity to play segments
of my tape and talk about Joyce and music.  To my astonishment she
said yes, and asked if I would like to come down for the Bloomsday
meeting, then only a couple of weeks away.  Short of the day I caught
my first sailfish, and possibly the day my eldest son was born, nothing
ever made me happier.  I was to be sandwiched in between two other
speakers, she said, but they wouldn't mind because they were regulars.
That was the beginning of a long association with what I think was
the first on-going organization in the United States and possibly anywhere
to devote itself entirely to the works and scholarship of James
Joyce.  The New York Joyce Society began in 1947 in the Gotham
Book Mart, one of the most unique bookstores in the world.  It was
in a sense the American version of Shakespeare and Company.  In the
heart of Manhattan, at 41 West 47th Street, it was the center of the
modernist literary movement in the United States, selling rare and
out-of-print books as well as the avant garde literature of the era to the
most sophisticated audience in this country, centered in New York.
The clientele were principally book people and theatrical people
who lived, worked, and visited in Manhattan, often attracted to the
Gotham by its stock of the "little magazines" that were unavailable
elsewhere in the country.
<p>
Frances Steloff had become the Sylvia Beach of New York, regularly
hosting visiting foreign writers as well as Americans, publishers,
artists, and academicians at the most prestigious literary gatherings
on this side of the Atlantic.  Establishing Joyce's reputation was one
of Frances's principal passions.  Having for years sold Joyce 's "Work in
Progress" as it appeared serially in transition , the Gotham was ready
in 1939 for a major publication party for <I>Finnegans Wake</I> .  Viking

Press, the publisher, cooperated with subsidies for the event and
John J.  Slocum loaned his fine Joyce collection (now at Yale) for the
event, in which scores of literary celebrities participated as mourners
and Frances herself as the bereaved widow.  W. G. Rogers tells us,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Eugene Jolas later brought back word from Paris that Joyce was amused
at the unique wake and pleased with the photographs.  .  .  .
This party, the regular sale of <I>transition</I> , and the general Joyceana
stacked on the little-magazine racks served to advertise the impression
that Joyce headquarters in America was West Forty-seventh Street.  .  .  .
Inquiries about the author, his life in Paris, and his baffling and challenging
opus kept pouring in.  Often an inquisitive admirer walked out of
the shop minutes before an expert with all the answers walked in.  Frances
Steloff decided that for the good of letters they should be brought together.
William York Tindall, Columbia 's Joyce authority, and an assistant,
James Gilvarry, agreed readily to receive students referred to them
on a casual basis.  1

Frances decided something more should be done and,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
she proposed to Maurice Speiser, a collector and lawyer, the formation
of the regular study group.  .  .  .  At his invitation Ben W.  Huebsch of
Viking, artist-designer E.  McKnight Kauffer, John J.  Slocum .  .  .  , Gilvarry,
Tindall, and Roland von Weber, then playing in a Library Theater
production of Joyce's <I>Exiles</I> , gathered for an organization meeting.

With Slocum as President,

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The James Joyce Society was born in the Gotham Book Mart in February
and June, 1947, and later incorporated.  It aimed to introduce Joyce
students to scholars, maintain a Joyce library, further the publications
and distribution of his works, encourage the presentation of Exiles , and
issue occasional bulletins.  .  .  .  The first membership in the society was
sold to .  .  .  T.  S.  Eliot.  (Rogers 226 .  27)

</BLOCKQUOTE>

Like the evolving international Joyce community as a whole,
the Joyce Society was never an exclusively academic enterprise, but

[page 77]

included anyone passionately interested in Joyce 's work.  Padraic Colum
succeeded Slocum as President, serving for more than a decade,
then William Tindall briefly, and then for nine more years I held the
position until I moved to Miami.  Sidney Feshbach had the longest
run as President and retired only recently, when Nick Fargnoli, the
current President, took over.

When I arrived at the Gotham that Bloomsday night in 1961, the
first person I saw was Padraic Colum, then the President of the Society.
And when I learned that the two speakers that evening who
agreed to give up some of their time for me were James T.  Farrell
and Joseph Campbell, I was overwhelmed.  A reading of Farrell 's realistic
short stories and gritty Chicago novels had convinced me during
my sophomore year in the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce
to switch over to Penn 's College of Liberal Arts and become
and English major, and Campbell 's work, even apart from the Skeleton
Key , put him at the pinnacle of scholarly discourse.  That night
his gloss of an illuminated manuscript of the <I>Tunc</I> page of the <I>Book of
Kells</I>, as represented in the <I>Wake</I> was one of the most memorable presentations
I have ever heard.  I wondered how the audience could ever
be even slightly amused, much less impressed, by the musical presentation
of a graduate student.  But, perhaps inadvertently, one person
was responsible for the little but memorable dramatic exchange
that came after the presentations and during the discussion period.
Seated among the Joycean luminaries that evening was Jack Dalton,
who was known to many older Joyceans as "Nasty Jack. " His life
was dedicated to correcting the textual mistakes of others, particularly
as they regarded <I>Ulysses</I>.  Jack stood up and indicated in no uncertain
terms one or two misreadings of the text in my recording.  At
the time I didn't know enough to demure gracefully to his challenge.
Indeed I didn't know much about anything but the "Lestrygonians"
episode, which I had been over literally thousands of times during
the previous year in the process of getting every word right on the final
tape.  In the process, I had memorized the text, and rattled off a
long section (with a gloss) of it in rebuttal.  Dalton had carried a copy
of <I>Ulysses</I> under his arm for so long it seemed like a growth in his
armpit, and when he opened the text to quote the chapter and verse
he found out that I was right.  He apologized and that began a long
association between us through the ensuing years of his turbulent
professional career.  He was a superb musician, I was later to learn, as
well as an organist and choir director, and a collector of nineteenth

[page 78]


century first editions, so we always had a lot to talk about after we
were done arguing about <I>Ulysses</I> .
<p>
At any rate, I really owed most of whatever success I had later in
my professional career to that night at the James Joyce Society meeting.
I drove back to New Jersey after it was over, and by ten o 'clock
the next morning was out flounder fishing in Barnegat Bay.  Was that
to be the end of the line? The Gotham was the only place in the East at
the time to carry a full stock of the "little literary magazines" from
Europe and the States that formed the impetus for what we think of
as High Modernism.  Next to where they were shelved I had seen the
night before a display of literary recordings including one or two albums
of Joyce Society meetings at the Gotham.  Back on the Bay, I
thought that the time might be now or never, and docked the boat
with three dead but uncleaned flounders still in it, grabbed the tapes
of the chapter, and headed back to the Gotham, where I arrived still
in my fishing cut-offs and tee shirt.  I was examining the recording
racks to find out which companies I might get hold of to audition
the tape, when Frances, who rarely left the store in those days, asked
if she could help.  She hadn't recognized me in my summer fishing
attire, despite my corpulent proportions, and when I told her I had
been on the program the previous night, and was looking for a place
that might audition my tapes, she remembered my presentation, and
was exceptionally complimentary about it.  She walked over to the
phone, dialed Moses Ash, and told him that she thought Folkways
Records would be interested in taking it on.  She sent me to their offices
only a block or two down the street, where Ash listened to my
tapes, and agreed on the spot to publish them.  He gave me a small
advance for the two-disk album, and a verbal commitment to publish
every other chapter I produced.  Four additional albums came out of
that agreement.

But that was not all that evening at the Joyce Society did to help
me on my way.  Several years later, after I had become a member and
a regular at meetings and Padraic Colum and I had become close
friends, we spent hours discussing his part in the Irish Literary Renaissance.
I was so fascinated that I decided to write the first book on
his career.  I wrote to Harry Moore, asking him, as Editor of Southern
Illinois University Press's Cross Currents Series, if he would entertain
a proposal for my Colum book.  Harry wrote back that he was in
the Gotham that first night, had heard and liked my presentation,
and would be delighted to give me a contract.  He also offered to


[page 79]

send me an advance along with the contract, the only advance on a
book I ever received in the forty years and ten volumes to follow.
<p>
The point to all of this is not to exult in my own luck, but to call
attention to what such literary associations can produce, and the sort
of great people who choose to offer their friendship and aid to others,
even at the beginning of their careers, in their celebration of the art of
James Joyce.  That sense of inclusion and help for neophytes as well
as established figures has always permeated Joyce studies and its associated
organizations in direct contradiction to many other scholarly
interest groups.  It is what especially characterizes Joyceans as a whole,
and certainly the James Joyce Society.
<p>
More than fifty years later the Joyce Society continues to flourish,
with three or four meetings a year upstairs in the Gotham Book Mart
in the Anna Livia Room, and substantially retains a mixture of members,
both academic and otherwise.  Through the twenty-five years
when I was in regular attendance at Society meetings, a host of great
Joyceans were always present, including many who made critical
history even though they were not full-time academics.  Most notable
were Ruth Von Phul, whose brief, if scatologically oriented,
comments opened the Freud/Joyce connection.  Ruth was not an academic,
but a professional Joyce reader, who left a 5000 page manuscript
of <I>Wake</I> explication when she died, along with scores of short
articles.  Max Halper, an art dealer with businesses in New York and
Provincetown, was another member whose splenetic, often comic,
commentaries on the <I>Wake</I> both enlightened and delighted us.  Frances'
lawyer in her many battles with censorship, Morris Ernst, was
another regular member.  He had argued the most celebrated obscenity
case in American literary history in defending Random House 's
publication of <I>Ulysses</I> , and frequently delivered his reminiscences on
the legalities associated with Joyce.  Other Society regulars included
Vicky Pomerantz, Edmund Epstein, Heyward Erlich, Bob Day, Milton
Malkin, and the ever loyal Myra Russell, principally responsible
for the permanent interest in <I>Chamber Music</I> .  For ten years or more,
avant garde film maker Mary Ellen Bute sat on the front row of Society
meetings.  Her full-length film, <I>Passages from "Finnegans Wake ,"</I>  was
adapted from the Barnard College production of Mary Manning's
work by the same name.  Conceived and carried on in concert with
Frances Steloff, Padraic Colum, and other Joyce Society members, it
remains the most innovative cinematic interpretation of the spirit
of Joyce 's last work ever attempted.  The person responsible for the

[page 80]


whole ongoing Joyce Society program was Philip Lyman, manager
of the Gotham, and the most devoted Joycean who ever attended a
meeting anywhere.  Then there were the celebrity speakers, authors
like Thornton Wilder and actors like Burgess Merredith, who came
to meetings when they were in town.  The list could go on and on.
I think there has to be something in Joyce and his work that particularly
attracts general readers and scholars alike to his humor, his
intellectual achievement, and his egalitarian outlook on life.  The
Joyce Society is a microcosm of the larger Joyce community: the
most open, honest, lively, fun-loving group of people who ever focused
their commonality on a single author, living or dead.  For us
Joyce is a way of life.
