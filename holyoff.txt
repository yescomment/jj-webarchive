                           The Holy Office

            Myself unto myself will give
            This name, Katharsis-Purgative.
            I, who dishevelled ways forsook
            To hold the poets' grammar-book,
            Bringing to tavern and to brothel
            The mind of witty Aristotle
            Lest bards in the attempt should err
            Must here be my interpreter:
            Wherefore receive now from my lip
            Peripatetic scholarship.
            To enter heaven, travel hell,
            Be piteous or terrible
            One positively needs the ease
            Of plenary indulgences.
            For every true-born mysticist
            A Dante is, unprejudiced,
            Who safe at ingle-nook, by proxy,
            Hazards extremes of heterodoxy
            Like him who finds a joy at table
            Pondering the uncomfortable.
            Ruling one's life by common sense
            How can one fail to be intense?
            But I must not accounted be
            One of that mumming company--
            With him who hies him to appease
            His giddy dames' frivolities
            While they console him when he whinges
            With gold-embroidered Celtic fringes--
            Or him who sober all the day
            Mixes a naggin in his play--
            Or him whose conduct "seems to own"
            His preference for a man of "tone"--
            Or him who plays the ragged patch
            To millionaires in Hazelpatch
            But weeping after holy fast
            Confesses all his pagan past--
            Or him who will his hat unfix
            Neither to malt nor crucifix
            But show to all that poor-dressed be
            His high Castilian courtesy--
            Or him who loves his Master dear--
            Or him who drinks his pint in fear--
            Or him who once when snug abed
            Saw Jesus Christ without his head
            And tried so hard to win for us
            The long-lost works of AEschylus.
            But all these men of whom I speak
            Make me the sewer of their clique.
            That they may dream their dreamy dreams
            I carry off their filthy streams
            For I can do those things for them
            Through which I lost my diadem,
            Those things for which Grandmother Church
            Left me severely in the lurch.
            Thus I relieve their timid arses,
            Perform my office of Katharsis.
            My scarlet leaves them white as wool:
            Through me they purge a bellyful.
            To sister mummers one and all
            I act as vicar-general
            And for each maiden, shy and nervous,
            I do a similar kind service.
            For I detect without surprise
            That shadowy beauty in her eyes,
            The "dare not" of sweet maidenhood
            That answers my corruptive "would."
            Whenever publicly we meet
            She never seems to think of it;
            At night when close in bed she lies
            And feels my hand between her thighs
            My little love in light attire
            Knows the soft flame that is desire.
            But Mammon places under ban
            The uses of Leviathan
            And that high spirit ever wars
            On Mammon's countless servitors
            Nor can they ever be exempt
            From his taxation of contempt.
            So distantly I turn to view
            The shamblings of that motley crew,
            Those souls that hate the strength that mine has
            Steeled in the school of old Aquinas.
            Where they have crouched and crawled and prayed
            I stand, the self-doomed, unafraid
            Unfellowed, friendless and alone,
            Indifferent as the herring-bone,
            Firm as the mountain-ridges where
            I flash my antlers on the air.
            Let them continue as is meet
            To adequate the balance-sheet.
            Though they may labour to the grave
            My spirit shall they never have
            Nor make my soul with theirs as one
            Till the Mahamanvantara be done:
            And though they spurn me from their door
            My soul shall spurn them evermore.
