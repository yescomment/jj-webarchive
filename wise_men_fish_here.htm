<li>In 2006, the Gotham Book Mart moved from its long-occupied space on West 47th Street to new quarters on East 46th Street. Unhappily, it fell deeply into debt and the landlord held an auction for its holdings in May 2007, as reported <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/23/nyregion/23gotham.html?_r=1&oref=slogin">
in <i>The New York Times</i></a>. <! See also
